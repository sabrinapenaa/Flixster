# Flix
Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [X] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
**WILL BE WORKING ON THESE LATER ON !**
- [ ] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [ ] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [ ] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
When building this app, I did encounter problems with Kotlin unresolved references, however, I was able to solve these problems by doing reserach and invalidating my cache. I also ran into problems with the SDK version I was using when compiling, and once again after some research, I was able to solve my problem. Since my TO DO app had utilized RecyclerView, I found it to be a lot easier to conceptualize how to use it using the movie information.
